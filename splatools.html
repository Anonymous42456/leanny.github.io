	<p><strong>Splatools</strong> is a tool, that gives you insight to some in-game mechanics of Splatoon with the goal to strengthen the competitive community. Currently it consists of an <strong>Effect Calculator</strong>, a <strong>Damage Calculator</strong> and <strong>Gear Stats</strong>.</p>
	<h2>Effect Calculator</h2>
	<p>The <strong>Effect Calculator</strong> displays the effects of certain abilities compared to a 'pure' version. You can check enter the ability you want to know more about and enter the number of main/sub abilities to see how much they affect your Inkling. On certain abilities, like Damage Up or Ink Saver (Main), you can also choose a specific weapon to see how the ability affects it.</p>

	<h2>Damage Calculator</h2>
	<p>The <strong>Damage Calculator</strong> is pretty straight forward. You enter the number of Damage Ups you have and the number of Defense Ups your opponent has and also enter the base damage the weapon deals. It will tell you how much damage you would deal if you hit the enemy. If you use a normal shooting weapon or sub weapon, you can also turn "Cap damage?" on, because they have a cap that cannot be exceeded.</p>

	<h2>Gear Stats</h2>
	<p>The <strong>Gear Stats</strong> will tell you the overall effects of your set. Just enter the abilities you have on certain gear and see the results. Abilities like Comeback will show you the results for the time they are active.</p>
