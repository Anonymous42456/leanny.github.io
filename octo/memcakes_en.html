        At last we meet, my so-called foe.
But is our fate to spray this hate?
Perhaps we'll learn in depths below...
       </td>
       <td>
        You gaze seaward with azure hope.
Between each blink you calmly think,
As when you use a Splatterscope.
       </td>
       <td>
        The rolling column splatters all.
A stray shot shakes the trees awake.
The summer turns, here comes the fall.
       </td>
       <td>
        You paint the turf with graceful strokes.
With watchful eye, I breathe a sigh.
From sniper's perch, I go for broke.
       </td>
       <td>
        With tresses pink and eyes a blank,
A smile so faint, it hides your feint,
You slip on past&mdash;outfoxed! Outflanked!
       </td>
       <td>
        The world I knew seems like a trap.
I'm drawn now to the strange and new.
Would my old friends think me a sap?
       </td>
       <td>
        Two fat and heavy locks hang low.
They frame your face above a base
Of stumpy leg and pigeon toe.
       </td>
       <td>
        A hilltop picnic, friends and fruit.
Your whirling blades provide us shade.
I raise a hand in mock salute.
       </td>
       <td>
        Destroy your troubles&mdash;bombs away!
A tempting thought: bring all to naught.
No wonder your friends tend to stray.
       </td>
       <td>
        You face away, thinking me blind,
Like I don't know what you won't show.
Your love is still clear from behind.

But when you burst, who's really cursed?
Your loved ones have to bear that load.

        It seems to you a sly attack,
But for your pains you make no gains.
You only get shot in the back.
       </td>

        How loftily you float on high,
Suspended there in starry air
As you drip purple passing by.
       </td>

        How desolate this star-marked limb.
Is what awaits me this same fate?
I must not dwell; it's much too grim.
       </td>
       <td>
        Though parted by the ocean deep,
My oldest friend, we meet again.
I touch your face; you rouse from sleep.
       </td>

        You overwhelm with crowds and throngs.
At every turn, you writhe and churn.
Why can't we simply get along?
       </td>

        Where love could blossom, spite congeals.
Faced with these thieves, I aim and heave
A cluster bomb right in the feels.

        The hunt leads down a winding path.
Tightly coiled and well-oiled,
These dirty squids could use a bath.

        Now nights grow long; summer abates.
The tides recede as squids stampede.
With fireworks, we celebrate.

        Erupting eel glimpses the sky.
Its eyelids squint against the glint
Of sun unseen by creatures shy.

No ink can halt your firm assault.

It's no hour for this shower,
But light rain won't ruin my day.

You're my last ditch to strike it rich
And tilt my bank balance aright.

And yet I spurned the lesson learned.
My problem is I have no chill.

        Another squid? I'm gonna hurl.
It's just litter! Please consider
How we Octolings see the world.

        We're torn apart so many times;
I must be bold and keep my hold
To make their team pay for their crimes.

        When four are one, they make a team.
But one from ten? Uhh, come again?
It's like some kind of fever dream.

Unblemished gun reflects the sun.

That's all a front. Let me be blunt;
It leaves you with nowhere to hide.

You pave the way as plain as day,
Foreshadowing imminent spew.

Its stagnant arms bring only harm,
Along with sluggish, looming dread.

        Our sweat dripping from every pore.
The harsh, hot sun won't stop this run.
We grit our teeth and ask for more.

        Squids often wear this as they strike
With bomb and brush. It's quite a rush.
Wish I could know what that was like...

The sandy shore I will endure
Just for that brisk, zephyrous tease.

A parcel stuffed with hope and love
And trimmed with stamps unorthodox.

Or get a clue and don't go through!

I might exchange them on the range,
